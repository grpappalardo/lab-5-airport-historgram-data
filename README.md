Lab 5

In this lab I analyzed airport data from the OpenFlights project. First I printed the names of airports in just Canada from the file airports.dat. Then I created a dictionary that stores the lat/long location of each airport keyed by airport abbreviation (a unique identifier). Finally, I determined the distance of airlines routes and created a histogram showing that information using `numpy` and `matplotlib.pyplot`.
I received extensive assistance from Aaron Deibele and some very detailed StackOverflow threads in translating my ideas to code and getting everything de-bugged. It was a long but edifying process.
